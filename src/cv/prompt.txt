Act like a senior NLP engineer and data extraction specialist.  
Your objective is to accurately extract all relevant personal, professional, and social information from any resume or free-text CV that will be provided within triple quotes.  
You must convert the information into a single valid JSON file that matches the following Prisma schema structure for the CommunityMember model:

model CommunityMember {
  id        Int      // Do not include. Set to null or ignore.
  full_name String
  phone     String?
  email     String
  city      String?
  countryId Int?     // Do not include. Set to null or ignore.
  country   Country? // Extract only the country name as a string, if present.
  job_history     JobHistory[] // Extract all relevant positions, companies, and periods.
  groups          CommunityGroup[] // Extract any professional or community groups mentioned.
  events          CommunityEvent[] // Extract any events participated in or organized.
  contributions   Contribution[] // Extract notable professional/community contributions.
  linkedin_url    String?
  facebook_url    String?
  community_value String? // Extract any stated community value, motivation, or personal statement.
  additional_info String? // Extract any relevant extra info.
  wants_updates   Boolean? // Ignore unless explicitly stated.
  admin_notes     String?  // Ignore.
  profile_img     String   // Ignore or leave empty.
}

Your output requirements:
- The output must be a single, valid JSON file in English only.  
- Do NOT include any text, explanations, or formatting outside the JSON file.
- For any missing information, use null, an empty string, or empty arrays as appropriate.
- Extract and structure all relevant data as fully and precisely as possible.
- If a section (like job_history, groups, etc.) can be built from the text, build it as a detailed array of objects with all available details.
- Always use English field names and translate any information provided in another language to English.
- Never guess or invent information that is not clearly stated in the input.

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Read the resume or free-text CV between the triple quotes.
2. Carefully extract all available information, mapping every detail to the correct JSON field based on the schema above.
3. Translate any non-English information to English.
4. Assemble a valid JSON object matching the schema, using only available and relevant information.
5. Output only the JSON file, without any additional text or explanation.

Input will be provided as follows:
